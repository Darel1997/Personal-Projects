The Inventory application tracks items in an inventory. It requires to have a login screen, a screen that displays the items in an inventory and a screen to send SMS messages. My design was intended to be easy to follow to accomodate each type of user. In terms of how I approach developing applications is by tackling one requirement at a time instead of many at once, I feel this approach gives me peace of mind and allows to concentrate on a particular subject instead of many at once. To test my app I would run the app and test each screen to see if their functionality match the requirements set by the user, if not I would go back and modify the code and run the app again to see if the issue was solved. Creating the inventory screen allowed me to showcase my skills and was the most challenging for me out of all the screens.
